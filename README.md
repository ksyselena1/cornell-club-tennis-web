# cornell-club-tennis-web

This is the website for my group project in INFO 1300 where we built an improved website for our client Cornell Club Tennis. 

Please feel free to see my design/documentation process in document/design_journey.md

Please note that this was worked on with 4 other Cornell students and I do not take full credit for the accomplishment. 

Also, this is not the original repository. The original repository was through a Cornell github account an is private for the class.
