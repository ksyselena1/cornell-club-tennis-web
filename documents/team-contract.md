# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. **To what goals do we all commit?**
- every team member should dedicate a sufficient amount of time every week to meet up, work on the project together, and discuss project deliverables
- every team member should be responsible for designing and coding at least one page of the website
- every team member should report any conflicts in the group chat as soon as it arises
- every team member should be communicating effectively through our group chat, including anytime we will be late or absent to an agreed meeting time. We agree to freely express our opinions, ideas, disagreements, etc.


2. **What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)**
- Respond in the group chat. Communicate.
- If unable to attend meetings, whether group or client, warn the group ahead of time (at least a day before).
- Break down the milestones so each member has equal opportunity to work.
  - If unable to complete part, ask for help!
- Complete your assigned part on time.

3. **By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?**
Our primary means of communication will be through the group chat we created. We will meet at least once a week for 2 hours on Tuesday afternoons. Our client meetings will also be held during those hours. We decided that we work most effectively on our individual parts remotely, but we plan to maximize our meeting time by distributing work as well as discussing and working parts of the project that we need to do collectively.

4. **How will we communicate and work with our client?**
We will communicate with our client via email for the most part and upon the weekly meetings we schedule, as well. Our client will receive updates on their website as the team feels fit to do so via email and/or if they want to meet outside the 3 required meetings. We will update them on our work progress after every project milestone is due so that we can seek their constructive feedback on our website design.

5. **What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.**
Each team member will be assigned the role of both designing a part of the website as well as coding part of it. At a minimum, this means that, as a **designer**, each person will be responsible for designing and sketching at least one page of the website and making sure it matches the overall design of the site. Then, as a **coder**, we will each be responsible for coding up our assigned page according to the design we created, being mindful of how our page's code fits with the overall code of the site. There will also be one person assigned to be the **point of contact** with the client, who is responsible for scheduling weekly meetings with the client and sending them updates on our work progress.

6. **How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?**
- We will ask the team member to explain what is causing them to fail to contribute a fair amount and work to resolve the issue. If they are having trouble with a concept, we will try to help them understand it, and if they are having trouble managing to submit their work on time, we will talk about how we could possibly reschedule to enable them to succeed. If this fails, we will have another discussion about their contributions. Finally, if they still fail to catch up, we will indicate on the final submission that they failed to contribute properly, which will be shown by the GIT commits.

7. **What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?**
- When we disagree, we will make sure to resolve the issue by being open about it and discussing the disagreement openly with the group. Every member should voice their opinion freely and be willing to listen to others' opinions as well.
- We agree to not keep things to ourselves and we agree not to talk badly of someone in the peer evaluation.

8. **What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?**
If at least one team member does one or more of the following at least twice, we, as a group, will revisit this contract during one of our team meetings and discuss the issue briefly to avoid future conflicts:
1. Does not 'push' or complete their work on time
2. Does not complete their work according to the standard that we, as a group, expect
3. Does not inform the group chat that he/ she will be late to the meeting for more than 15 minutes
4. Does not actively contribute in group discussions

9. **What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)**
- We will try to get to know each other outside of INFO 1300 class. We will do this by having small talks and learning more about each other's likes, dislikes, and interests. We will also try to plan and engage in team bonding activities, such as getting food or boba together. Getting to know each team member may be helpful to know about how we work best together.
- We will not be judgmental of each other's weaknesses and, instead, will help each other out by teaching one another our respective strengths and skills.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
