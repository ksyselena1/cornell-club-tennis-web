                <p class="servicep">Into the Streets is Cornell's biggest public service event. Over 500 volunteers participate, volunteering at agencies that contribute to the welfare of the local Ithaca community, such as farms or local businesses. </p>

                <p class="serviceheader">How do we volunteer?</p>
                <p class="servicep">​Into the Streets is a great program that allows different clubs or groups to volunteer together. This past year, we had a group of 7 members led by our philanthropy chair, Caroline Zhou, participate at West Haven Farm, helping the local farmers plant and peel garlic cloves! They learned about sustainable farming techniques and got to try fresh produce ranging from cherry tomatoes to apples, all while helping the local community!</p>
